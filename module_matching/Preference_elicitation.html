    Imagine you are at the start of the semester and need to choose two modules in order to complete your degree. <br>
    In this screen you have the choice to rank the following modules according to your personal choice: <br>
    - Monetary policy <br>
    - Brand management <br>
    - Financial analysis <br>
    - History of economic ethics <br>
    Your favourite module will therefore become your first priority.
