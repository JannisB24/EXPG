        <h4>Statistical information</h4>
        Thank you for sharing your personal preferences. <br>
        Now, we would like to provide you with information about the other participants and present a comprehensive summary of your own voting choices. <br>
        <br>These numbers reflect how frequently you and your fellow participants chose each module as your first priority:
        <style>
            td:first-child {
              padding-right: 10px;
            }
          </style>    
            <table>
            <tr>
                <td>Monetary policy:</td>
                <td>{{ group.prio_1_monetary_policy }}</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Brand management:</td>
                <td>{{ group.prio_1_brand_management }}</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Financial analysis:</td>
                <td>{{ group.prio_1_financial_analysis }}</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>History of economic ethics:</td>
                <td>{{ group.prio_1_history_of_economics_ethics }}</td>
            </tr>
            </table>
          <br>
        <br>Here is the breakdown of how you ranked the modules in the previous screen (1 being your first priority):
        <table>
            <tr>
            <td>Monetary policy:</td>
            <td>{{ player.prio_monetary_policy_1 }}</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
            <td>Brand management:</td>
            <td>{{ player.prio_brand_management_1 }}</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
            <td>Financial analysis:</td>
            <td>{{ player.prio_financial_analysis_1 }}</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
            <td>History of economic ethics:</td>
            <td>{{ player.prio_history_of_economics_ethics_1 }}</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </p>

    <br>Now, you will be in competition with your group members. For each module listed above, there are only two available seats. <br>
    This means that if everyone has the same module as their top choice, only two individuals will be able to enroll.<br><br>
    At the beginning, you ranked all the modules from 1 to 4 based on your priorities. You can find an overview of your choices in the provided box. These preferences will ultimately determine your payoff at the end of the experiment. <br>
    Ultimately, all group members will be ranked based on the number of payoff points they have accumulated. <br>
    Subsequently, a member will be randomly selected to receive sweets based on their collected payoff points. <br> <br>
    Below is an overview indicating the number of points you would receive for each priority:
    <table>
        <tr>
        <td>First priority:</td>
        <td>4 points</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>Second priority:</td>
        <td>3 points</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>Third priority:</td>
        <td>2 points</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>Fourth priority:</td>
        <td>1 point</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
