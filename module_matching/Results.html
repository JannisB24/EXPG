<p>
    Thank you for participating in our experiment. These are the modules that you obtained:
</p>

<table class="table" style="width:600px">

    <tr>
        <th>WPM 1</th>
        <th>WPM 2</th>
    </tr>

<tr>
    <td>{{ player.WPM1 }}</td>
    <td>{{ player.WPM2 }}</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>
    With a total payoff of x points you are ranked xth among your peers. You were / were not chosen to receive a sweet payoff.

        Remember the current module allocation system at Goethe University: <br>
        You are able to rank modules with capacity constraints according to your preferences (just like you did in the first screen). <br>
        Then students are ordered randomly, with the first student in line being able to choose his/her first preference. <br>
        If you compare the system at Goethe University with the mechanism you just played in... <br>
