    Thank you for your participation in our experiment. Here are the modules that you have been assigned to:

<table class="table" style="width:600px">

    <tr>
        <th>WPM 1</th>
        <th>WPM 2</th>
    </tr>

<tr>
    <td>{{ player.WPM1 }}</td>
    <td>{{ player.WPM2 }}</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>
    Congratulations on achieving a total payoff of {{ player.Points }} points, which places you at {{ player.Rank }} rank among your peers. You were / were not chosen to receive a sweet payoff.<br>

        Remember the current module allocation system at Goethe University: <br>
        You are able to rank modules with capacity constraints according to your preferences (just like you did in the first screen). <br>
        Then students are ordered randomly, with the first student in line being able to choose his/her first preference. <br>
        If you compare the system at Goethe University with the mechanism you just played in... <br>
